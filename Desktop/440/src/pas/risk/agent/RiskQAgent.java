 * decoder?</li>
 * <li>How is a state (e.g. a {@link GameView}) perceived by the model? This is
 * done via a
 * {@link MyStateSensorArray} object which is responsible for converting a
 * {@link GameView} into a feature
 * vector which *must* be a row-vector.</li>
 * <li>How is an {@link Action} perceived by the model? This is done via a
 * {@link MyActionSensorArray} object which is responsible for converting a
 * {@link Action} into a feature
 * vector which *must* be a row-vector.</li>
 * <li>How is a {@link Territory} perceived by the model? This is done via a
 * {@link MyPlacementSensorArray} object which is responsible for converting a
 * {@link Territory} into a feature
 * vector which *must* be a row-vector.</li>
 * <li>How is the model punished/pleasured according to the quality of
 * {@link Action}s that it chooses? This
 * is done via a {@link MyActionRewardFunction} which you can configure to
 * calculate R(s), R(s,a),
 * or R(s,a,s')</li>
