/**
 * <p>
 * Represents a function which punishes/pleasures your model according to how
 * well the {@link Territory}s its been
 * choosing to place armies have been. Your reward function could calculate
 * R(s), R(s,t), or (R,t,a'): whichever
 * is easiest for you to think about (for instance does it make more sense to
 * you to evaluate behavior when you see a
 * state, the action you took in that state, and how that action resolved? If so
 * you want to pick R(s,t,s')).
 *
 * <p>
 * By default this is configured to calculate R(s). If you want to change this
 * you need to change the
 * {@link RewardType} enum in the constructor *and* you need to implement the
 * corresponding method. Refer to
 * {@link RewardFunction} and {@link RewardType} for more details.
